# Domain-Driven Design Project - 150 Days Commit Challenge
ðŸš€ Welcome to the Challenge!

Overview:
I've embarked on a 150-day commit challenge to enhance and evolve the Domain-Driven Design Project. This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in a practical setting.

Challenge Goals:

Consistency: I commit to making meaningful contributions every day for the next 150 days.
Project Evolution: Enhance the existing DDD project, adding features, improving code quality, and refining domain models.
